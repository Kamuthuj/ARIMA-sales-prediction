# ARIMA time series forecasting.

This project demonstrates how to analyze and forecast monthly sales data using advanced time series modeling techniques such as ARIMA and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing. The project includes seasonal decomposition, stationarity testing and visualizations for better insights into the dataset. It begins by processing the dataset, converting dates to a proper format, and aggregating sales by month. The sales data is visualized, decomposed for trend, seasonality and residuals and tested for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. ARIMA modeling is then applied, with automatic parameter selection and forecasting for 12 periods, including confidence intervals for prediction accuracy.
