# ARIMA time series forecasting.

# Project overview.
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting monthly sales data using advanced time series modeling techniques. Key approaches include ARIMA and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing, with additional steps for seasonal decomposition and stationarity testing to uncover trends, seasonality, and residual patterns.

# Data processing.
The dataset was prepared by:

- Converting dates into a proper format.
- Aggregating sales data by month.
These steps ensured the data was well-structured for time series analysis.

# EDA Analysis.

1. Visualizations
Monthly sales trends were visualized to identify patterns over time.
2. Seasonal Decomposition
The data was decomposed into trend, seasonality, and residuals to better understand its components.
3. Stationarity Testing
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was used to assess stationarity, a critical requirement for ARIMA modeling.

# Time Series Modeling
1. ARIMA Modeling
ARIMA was applied with automatic parameter selection.
Forecasts were generated for 12 future periods, including confidence intervals to quantify prediction accuracy.
2. Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing
This method was also explored as an alternative to capture seasonality and trends effectively.
